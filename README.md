# Horiseon-site

## Description
This webpage was refactored to make it more accessible and was optimized for search engines. Some links were repaired to function properly. The CSS was reworked by consolidating CSS selectors and properties. Lastly CSS selectors and properties were re-structured to follow HTML elements  and a comments were included before each element or section of the page.
